## Problem

In an empty world, we have a chair that has a linear oscillating motion. This chair is equipped with and Inertial Measurement Unit. and is being observed by a camera.

## Objective

To write a Kalman filter to combine the data from the camera and the IMU to estimate the position of the chair at any given time.
